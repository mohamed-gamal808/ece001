Artificial Intelligence ( AI) history started in the antiquity, with myths , stories and rumors of artificial beings created by master craftsmen with intellect or consciousness. Classical philosophers planted the seeds of modern AI, who sought to explain the mechanism of human thought as the computational manipulation of symbols. This research resulted in the 1940s invention of the programmable digital computer, a system based on the mathematical reasoning's abstract nature. This system and the concepts behind it motivated a number of scientists to start discussing the prospect of creating an artificial brain seriously.The field of AI research was developed during the summer of 1956 at a workshop held on the Dartmouth College campus.[1] Those who attended would become the pioneers in AI research for decades. Many of them believed there would be a computer as intelligent as a human being in no more than a century and millions of dollars were given to make this dream come true.Eventually it became clear they had massively underestimated the project's complexity. In 1973, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected work into artificial intelligence in response to criticism from James Lighthill and continuing pressure from congress, and the tough years that followed would later be known as a "AI winter." Seven years later, the Japanese government's groundbreaking program encouraged governments and industry to give billions of dollars to AI, but by the late 80's the investors were disillusioned and withdrew funding again.Investment and interest in AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century, when machine learning was successfully applied to many academic and industrial problems due to innovative techniques, strong computer hardware implementation, and large data sets collection.
