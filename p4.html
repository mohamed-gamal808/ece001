<h2>(AI) for agriculture</h2>
New AI developments in agriculture show increases in yield benefit and in increasing the research and production of growing crops. Modern artificial intelligence now predicts how long it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready to select, thus increasing farming efficiency.[2] These developments continue to include crop and soil tracking, agricultural robotics, and predictive analytics. Crop and soil monitoring uses new field-gathered algorithms and data to control and track crop health, making it simpler and more sustainable for farmers.More AI specializations in agriculture include such techniques as greenhouse automation, simulation, modeling, and optimization.

Because of population growth and potential growth in food demand, farm yields would need to increase by at least 70 per cent to meet this new demand. More and more people believe that implementing these new technologies and using Artificial Intelligence would help achieve this goal.
